            <p>You have been such a positive and powerful person to so many people. 
                You tend to measure your self in the mistakes you have made, but 
                everyone makes mistakes. I measure you in the way you recover and 
                good that I see you do and I see actions that are so much more than 
                powerful than any mistakes. Look at the friends you have and you will 
                see it too.</p>
